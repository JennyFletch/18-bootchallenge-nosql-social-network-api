A social network API with users, thoughts and reactions. Users can be connected to one another as friends and leave reactions on all thoughts saved to the data collections. This project was created using a non-relational database for flexibility with what could potentially amount to  large amounts of unstructured data. Getters were used to format timestamps and to keep a virtual count of user thoughts and reactions.
